# ML5G-PS-012-Xdding
Team Xdding's solution to the Home User Network Classification problem statement by ZTE.

# Repository Overview
`models`: Directory storing the models that gave meaningful results: best RNN checkpoint, TSFresh + XGBoost model, and TSFresh + PCA + XGBoost model.

`notebooks`: Directory storing notebooks for each approach mentioned in the report: ROCKET classifier, LSTM RNN, manual feature extraction + XGBoost model, both TSFresh + XGBoost model variants, and `ts_regularization.ipynb` to generate preprocessed data for ROCKET/LSTM RNN from included zip file (unzip first).
